# android_app_forecast_search
android app for forecast search in America

need to modify AerisMap identification information and facebook indentification information. also please check all the sdk versions, they may become incompatible as upgraded

also, because I may close up the AWS server, so you need to change the url of fetching json data of weather(in the MainActivity.java, line283, function name 'createRequestUrl')

and the php file is in my "web-application" repository called forecast.php. need to put it in your server and get access to it.
